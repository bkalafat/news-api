# Feature Specification: .NET 8 Modernization with Clean Architecture

**Feature Branch**: `002-modernize-net-core`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Modernize .NET Core 3.1 News API to .NET 8 with Clean Architecture"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a development team, we need to modernize the existing .NET Core 3.1 News API to .NET 8 LTS with Clean Architecture principles to ensure the codebase is maintainable, secure, and follows modern development standards while preserving all existing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current .NET Core 3.1 News API, **When** the modernization is complete, **Then** the API runs on .NET 8 LTS with all existing endpoints functioning identically
2. **Given** the modernized API, **When** developers examine the code structure, **Then** they see clear separation between Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers
3. **Given** the updated security configuration, **When** sensitive data is needed, **Then** it is retrieved from User Secrets (development) or Azure Key Vault (production) with no hardcoded values
4. **Given** any API endpoint receives input, **When** the input is processed, **Then** comprehensive server-side validation protects against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
5. **Given** the modernized codebase, **When** new features are developed, **Then** they follow the repository pattern with proper dependency injection

### Edge Cases
- What happens when MongoDB connection fails during startup?
- How does the system handle malformed JSON input to API endpoints?
- What occurs when Azure Key Vault is unavailable in production?
- How are database connection timeouts handled?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST upgrade from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 8 LTS while maintaining backward compatibility of all API endpoints
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement Clean Architecture with distinct Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers
- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce dependency rules where Domain layer has no external dependencies and all dependencies point inward
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement repository pattern with clear interfaces for all data access operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST use dependency injection for all service registrations and configurations
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate all input data on the server-side using modern validation frameworks
- **FR-007**: System MUST protect against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities including SQL Injection and XSS
- **FR-008**: System MUST store sensitive configuration data using .NET Secret Manager for development environments
- **FR-009**: System MUST support Azure Key Vault integration for production secret management
- **FR-010**: System MUST use only actively maintained NuGet packages with no known security vulnerabilities
- **FR-011**: System MUST follow official Microsoft C# coding conventions throughout the codebase
- **FR-012**: System MUST use C# 12 language features and modern programming paradigms
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain all existing CRUD operations for News entities
- **FR-014**: System MUST preserve existing MongoDB integration with updated driver versions
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain existing caching functionality for performance optimization

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: All API responses MUST maintain sub-200ms response times for cached content
- **NFR-002**: System MUST support the same CORS origins as the current implementation
- **NFR-003**: Docker containerization MUST be updated to support .NET 8 runtime
- **NFR-004**: System MUST maintain 100% API endpoint compatibility during transition
- **NFR-005**: Code coverage MUST be maintainable through clear separation of concerns

### Key Entities
- **News**: Core content entity with metadata, categorization, and content fields
- **NewsService**: Service layer abstraction for news operations
- **DatabaseSettings**: Configuration entity for MongoDB connection management
- **CacheKeys**: Static configuration for memory caching strategies
